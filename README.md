### Hi there 👋

I'm Gray! I'm an artist, programmer, bit-twiddler, and lover of fantasy and romance. My first priority is my art, and I see code as a fun and interesting way to improve and create art. I have contributed to the Rust computer graphics community over the past few years and completed Google Summer of Code in 2019 with [appleseed](https://github.com/appleseedhq/appleseed/). Huge thanks to my current and potential sponsors for supporting my work!
