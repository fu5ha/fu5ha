### Hi there 👋

I'm Gray! I'm an artist, programmer, gamer, bit-twiddler, and lover of fantasy and romance. My first priority is creative expression, and I see code as a fun and interesting way to augment creative processes. I have contributed to the Rust computer graphics community over the past few years, completed Google Summer of Code in 2019 with [appleseed](https://github.com/appleseedhq/appleseed/), and now work at [Embark Studios](https://www.embark-studios.com/) on a new [creative-play platform](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/homegrown-rendering-with-rust-1e39068e56a7). Huge thanks to my sponsors for supporting my work!
