### Hi there 👋

I'm Gray! I'm an artist, programmer, gamer, bit-twiddler, and doer of way too many niche sports. My first priority is creative expression, and I see code as a fun and interesting way to augment creative processes. I have contributed to the Rust computer graphics community over the past few years, completed Google Summer of Code in 2019 with [appleseed](https://github.com/appleseedhq/appleseed/), and now work at [Embark Studios](https://www.embark-studios.com/) doing a wide variety of different things.
